# Expo ImagePicker `uri` Property Bug

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using Expo's ImagePicker library.  The `uri` property of the returned image object is occasionally null or undefined, leading to application crashes.  The bug appears to be related to the size of the image or its origin.

## Steps to Reproduce

Reproducing this bug is challenging; however, it's most likely to occur under these conditions:

1. Use a very large image.
2. Select an image from a source other than the device's native gallery.
3. Work with images with unusual metadata.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a robust way to handle this scenario.  It introduces null checks and alternative processing methods to ensure your application doesn't crash when the `uri` is missing.
