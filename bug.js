This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue arises when attempting to access the `uri` property of an image object returned by `launchImageLibraryAsync` or `launchCameraAsync`. Under certain conditions, particularly when dealing with large images or images from specific sources, the `uri` property might be null or undefined, leading to errors and crashes in your application.
